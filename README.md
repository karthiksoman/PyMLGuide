This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks primarily intended for pedagogical purposes, focusing on the hands-on teaching of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The content covers the implementation of ML algorithms using both conventional and deep neural network approaches on datasets that encompass both biological and non-biological data that are publicly available.
